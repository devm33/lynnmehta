I attribute my love of the outdoors and different places to childhood days at the beach, summer backpacking and camping trips, living in India when I was 10 years old, and miles of traveling. Both new and familiar landscapes inspire me.<\/p>\n<h3><em><strong>My love of art has been my life.<\/strong><\/em><\/h3>\n<p>I was influenced by the art of my mom who painted the California landscape and encouraged my interest in art by setting up my toddler easel outdoors, enrolling me in art classes, giving me personal instruction, and purchasing a<span style=\"font-family: 'Open Sans';\">rt supplies for me. I developed a love for books early and spent hours pouring over the &#8220;Art for Children&#8221; books by Ernest Lloyd Raboff, especially Pablo Picasso and Paul Klee.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>As my own children were growing up, I taught part-time at their school, heading up the Art Summer Camp and Extended Day Art Program. I learned much about the joy of learning and exploring while teaching children.\u00a0 My fascination with learning about art and art history led my to obtain a Certificate in World Art from the Smithsonian Associate Program in Washington, DC.<\/p>\n<h3><strong><em>Professional Artist<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone  wp-image-2782\" src=\"https:\/\/wordpress.lynnmehta.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/LynnMehta_headshot_website_scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"328\" height=\"459\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wordpress.lynnmehta.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/LynnMehta_headshot_website_scaled.jpg 1429w, https:\/\/wordpress.lynnmehta.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/LynnMehta_headshot_website_scaled-214x300.jpg 214w, https:\/\/wordpress.lynnmehta.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/LynnMehta_headshot_website_scaled-732x1024.jpg 732w, https:\/\/wordpress.lynnmehta.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/LynnMehta_headshot_website_scaled-768x1075.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wordpress.lynnmehta.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/LynnMehta_headshot_website_scaled-549x768.jpg 549w, https:\/\/wordpress.lynnmehta.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/LynnMehta_headshot_website_scaled-1097x1536.jpg 1097w, https:\/\/wordpress.lynnmehta.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/LynnMehta_headshot_website_scaled-107x150.jpg 107w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 328px) 100vw, 328px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">As a full-time artist I teach classes, workshops, and mentor students.\u00a0 I enjoy engaging in demonstrations, public art talks, and jurying shows.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Throughout my career, I have been the recipient of\u00a0 numerous honors and awards.
